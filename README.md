# cics-java-liberty-ejb
A Java EE EJB sample application to simulate a simple web shop to follow the article in the CICS developer center: [EJBs in Liberty JVM server &ndash; a Web Shop example](https://developer.ibm.com/cics/2017/08/21/cics-ejb/)

  * StockApplication.java - JAX-RS application defining the REST endpoints
  * StockCreateRequest.java - Java class representing a request to create a new item in stock
  * StockUpdateRequest.java - Java class representing a request to update existing stock

## Requirements
* CICS TS for z/OS V5.3 with APAR [PI63877](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI63877) applied, or CICS TS for z/OS V5.4, or later
* Security enabled on the CICS region (`SEC=YES`)
* Eclipse with WebSphere Developer Tools and CICS Explorer SDK installed - Local development and bundle deployment

### Optional Requirements

## Deploying the Sample

To deploy the sample you will need to import the projects into CICS Explorer. 

To install the sample as a CICS bundle:

1. Export the CICS bundle from Eclipse by selecting the project **com.ibm.cicsdev.ejb.bundle** > **Export Bundle Project to z/OS UNIX File System**. 
2. Define and install a JVMSERVER resource named `DFHWLP` in the CICS region.
3. Add the features `ejbLite-3.2`, `jsf-2.2` and `jaxrs-2.0` to the `featureManager` element in the Liberty JVM server's server.xml configuration file.
4. Define and install a BUNDLE resource.

To install the sample through Liberty configuration
1. Export the EAR project from Eclipse by selecting the project **com.ibm.cicsdev.ejb.app** > **File** > **Export** > **EAR file** > **Next** > choose a destination > **Finish**.
2. Copy the EAR file in binary to the `apps` directory in the Liberty configuration directory on zFS.
3. Replace the Liberty configuration file `server.xml` or update elements featureManager, safRegistry and application using [server.xml](etc/config/server.xml) as a basis.
4. Install a JVMSERVER resource in the CICS region.

**Note:** JVM server autoconfigure will configure the JVM server with the necessary elements in server.xml. Ensure autoconfigure is enabled in the JVM profile of the JVMSERVER used to run this sample.

If the sample is correctly deployed, you should see the following messages in the Liberty logs:

```
A CWWKT0016I: Web application available (default_host): http://mvs.example.ibm.com:9080/shop/
...
A CWWKT0016I: Web application available (default_host): http://mvs.example.ibm.com:9080/stock/
```

If you use CICS bundle deployment, you will also need to define a RACF EJBROLE profile for users to access the stock REST API which is protected by the Administrator role.

```
RDEFINE EJBROLE BBGZDFLT.com.ibm.cicsdev.ejb.Administrator UACC(NONE) 
PERMIT BBGZDFLT.com.ibm.cicsdev.ejb.Administrator CLASS(EJBROLE) ACCESS(READ) ID(WEBUSER) 
```

If you don't have RACF access, you could alter the `Administrator` role in the [CatalogueBean](projects/com.ibm.cicsdev.ejb/ejbModule/com/ibm/cicsdev/ejb/CatalogueBean.java) to be the `cicsAllAuthenticated` role instead, which is always configured for CICS bundles, 

## Running the Sample
To create new items in the store send an authenticated HTTP request to the stock API. The authenticated user must have access to the role named in the CatalogueBean.

```http
POST /stock/api/items HTTP/1.1
Host: <hostname>:<port>
Content-Type: application/json
Authentication: BASIC <base64 encoded username,password>

{ "name": "CICS TS for z/OS", "stock": 2 }
```
The response returned will be similar to:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"id":1,"name":"CICS TS for z/OS","stock":2}
```

You can issue this request using the command line tool cURL, replacing hostname, port and WEBUSER with your own values.

```shell
curl <hostname>:<port>/stock/api/items/ -X POST -d '{ "name": "CICS TS for z/OS", "stock": 2 }' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --user <WEBUSER>
```

**Note:** We use HTTP BASIC authentication in this example but other forms of authentiation could be used.  


Once one or more items have been created, you can then use a browser to navigate to http://hostname:port/shop/ and use the shop via the CartBean. There is no role protecting
the CartBean so these requests do not need to be authenticated.

More stock can be added to an item through the following HTTP request (in this case we update item with the ID `1`):

```http
PUT /stock/api/items/1
Host: <hostname>:<port>
Content-Type: application/json
Authentication: BASIC <base64 encoded username,password>

{ "ammount": 10 }
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"id":1,"name":"CICS TS for z/OS","stock":12}
```

You can view the current state of an item by sending a GET request (in this case we get the item with the ID `1`):

```http
GET /stock/api/items/1
Host: <hostname>:<port>
Accept: application/json
Authentication: BASIC <base64 encoded username,password>
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"id":1,"name":"CICS TS for z/OS","stock":12}
```

### Further Configuration
Because CICS TSQs are not recoverable by default, to get the benefit of EJB transactions in the project, you would need to define a TS model definition similar to this:

```
DEFINE TSMODEL(JAVAEJB) GROUP(SAMPEJB) PREFIX(CATALOGUE) RECOVERY(YES)
```

## Importing the Projects into Eclipse
All the projects with code are Eclipse projects. To import these projects:

1. In Eclipse select **File** > **Import** > **General/Existing Projects into Workspace**
2. **Browse** to the `projects` directory.
3. Ensure all 5 projects are checked
4. **Finish** to import the source projects.


## Notes
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is linked to for styling of the JSF web pages. This is pulled from a content delivery network (CDN) online. If external links are blocked, these web pages will continue to work without Bootstrap, but the Bootstrap CSS can also be downloaded and added by changing the `link` element:

```html
<!-- Replace the CDN Boostrap CSS -->
